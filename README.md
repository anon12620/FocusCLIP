# FocusCLIP: Multimodal Subject-Level Guidance for Zero-Shot Transfer in Human-Centric Tasks

## Abstract

We introduce FocusCLIP, which integrates subject-level guidance--a specialized mechanism for target-specific supervision--into the CLIP framework for enhanced zero-shot transfer on human-centric tasks. Our approach narrows the search space by leveraging auxiliary supervision, emphasizing subject-relevant image regions through Region-of-Interest (ROI) heatmaps that emulate human visual attention mechanisms. Combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-rich pose descriptions, this leads to a more focused embedding alignment. In our experiments, FocusCLIP, trained with images from the MPII Human Pose dataset and enriched with our novel pose descriptions, surpassed a simple baseline by 4.78 points, achieving an average accuracy of 24.54\% across a variety of unseen datasets and human-centric tasks. When also provided with person heatmaps, the accuracy increased to 30.52\%, a further 5.98 point gain, underlining the efficacy of subject-focused supervision. Additionally, we release a high-quality MPII Pose Descriptions dataset, encouraging further research in the field. Our findings emphasize the potential of integrating subject-level guidance with general pretraining methods for enhanced performance in downstream tasks.
